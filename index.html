<p>St. Mary’s Academy is recognized by the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi. It prepares students for the All Indian Secondary School Examination according to the 10+2 system of education.

St. Mary’s Academy, Saharanpur, is a minority educational institution, recognized by the National Commission for Minority Educational Institution Act 2004, covered under article 30 of the Constitution of India. All important decisions are taken by its Managing Committee. In its day-to-day affairs, the Academy is administered by the Manager and the principal. In urgent cases, their decision is final.

St. Mary’s Academy is a co-educational institution where students learn to treat the members of the opposite sex with genuine respect, develop a love for truth and to be rooted in the rich cultural heritage of India.

English is the medium of instruction but Hindi is also given equal importance from the very start of a child’s schooling since Hindi is the language of the place and knowledge of Hindi is very essential for a successful career in India. According to the new Education Policy, the Central Board of Secondary Education has directed its affiliated institutions to teach Sanskrit as a part of Hindi from class V to VIII. We abide by this directive.
